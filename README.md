# TempStat
Project Description
TempStat is a C program designed to analyze large-scale weather station temperature data. The program processes a text file containing millions of temperature measurements from various weather stations and calculates key statistical metrics (minimum, maximum, and mean temperature) for each station.
Features

Dual implementation approach:

Memory-mapped I/O (mmap) implementation
Standard file I/O (fread) implementation


Efficient handling of large datasets (50+ million rows)
Statistical analysis per weather station
Memory-efficient data processing
